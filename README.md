Useful scripts
--------------

Contains functions that I coded for ease of use in projects. Or 
functions I copied from someone else, or 
functions that were written inspired by someone else's code.

Also contains Data structures and Algorithm implementations. 
And common programs taught in CS course.

## Todo
1. Create a program that lets you see directory structure and lets you search in that directory structure.
It should also store the last modified file.

Usecase: Manyatimes I forget, what are the folders that are meant to be backup for certain kind of files. And also, their paths.
Maybe, we should also give each directory a description saying this is the folder for this file.
We can also show recently used folders or frequently used folders.
We can let the user make some folder not appear in the above lists at all.

1. `copy_to_harddisk.py`
1. `get_files_modified_after.py`
